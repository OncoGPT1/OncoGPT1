In September 2021, the main lesion of the right kidney was removed, and the immune K drug monotherapy was maintained after that. Until the enhanced CT review on February 10, 2022, the systemic lesions were generally stable. Since the use of antibiotics on March 8, the pain in the tenderness of the descending colon, which was originally severe pain, has been greatly improved. However, severe headache, high fever (38\u00b0+), and continuous sweating all over the body appeared after the medication. In order to suppress the high fever, the local hospital prescribed celecoxib orally. After taking the medicine, the body temperature did drop, but once the effect of the medicine wore off, the fever continued. Until March 12, antibiotics had been used for five consecutive days. Continued medication and persistent high fever will have adverse effects on the next step of double immunotherapy, and patients will increasingly feel the discomfort caused by metastatic lesions. We are very worried that the continued use of antibiotics will inevitably have a negative impact on the subsequent replacement of dual immunotherapy, and we have stopped using antibiotics since last night.

I understand your concern and would explain that dark stools are very concerning about a gastrointestinal hemorrhage (related to diverticulitis or any other disorders). Your past medical history for diverticulitis and colon cancer could be related to these symptoms. But a common viral gastroenteritis as the cause of this symptomatology can not be excluded. I recommend consulting with your gastroenterologist for a careful physical examination, an abdominal ultrasound, a stool analysis, some lab blood tests including: a complete blood count, PCR, sedimentation rate, CEA, CA19.9 (tumor antigens), etc. A GI endoscopy is necessary to exclude possible lesions of the digestive tract if suspicions are raised.

My present condition is extremely good and has been so since surgery. On my most recent restaging and evaluation (Sept 2012) the term malignant neoplasm of prostate was included as an alert notice. I did not read this note until just recently. I am wondering if this indicates a change in my diagnosis, or has this terminology been relevant from day one?",
  "output":"Hi, Your prostate cancer risk stratification should be mentioned. You should mention your baseline PSA value before treatment and staging based on pathology report. As your Gleason score was 10 most probably your disease was high risk prostate cancer. In this case adjuvant radiation may have some role (pelvic radiation). Anyway it is not clear whether radiotherapy was given or not. Now you have to check your PSA value at regular interval. As radical prostatectomy has been done then PSA value more than 0.2 NG\/ml may indicate biochemical failure. Then your treatment can be changed. Another issue you have to know whether at any time your PSA value came below 0.03 NG\/ml or not. This has got prognostic implication. Prostate cancer and malignant neoplasm of prostate are synonymous. Take care."

  "output":"Hi, Thanks for writing in. Colon cancer is treated completely by surgery if detected in early stage. However, CEA is to be done regularly to know the progressive increase and possibility of a recurrence of the tumor. Colon cancer might cause liver spread and this also has to be looked for by doing an ultrasound scan and CT scan if required.

Hysterectomy may be done for both uterine cancer and cervix cancer (total hysterectomy with bilateral ovary and tube removal). The problem you have mentioned probably is a post-operative complication. During operation gut handling may be the cause. As you have not mentioned on what post-operative day the problem started detail explanation is a bit difficult but regular electrolyte monitoring preferably at 24 hr interval and conservative management is the best option.

  "output":"Thanks for your question on OncoGPT. I can understand your concern. Scarring is more common after radiation than cancer. So for your symptoms, possibility of bladder scarring is more than bladder cancer. But biopsy is must differentiate between these two. So get done biopsy for the diagnosis. If it is scarring then treatment is available and your problem can be solved. But if it turned out to be malignant then you need to get done staging of the cancer. Future treatment will be decided on staging of the tumor only. Early stages of bladder cancer is having good prognosis with life expectancy of 6-7 years.

It is grouped as an aggressive cancer and should be closely observed for appearances elsewhere in the body even after surgical treatment. If your mother is having severe headaches then she must get an urgent CT scan or MRI scan brain done at the earliest. There have been patients with spread of cancer to the brain and in many cases it is malignant melanoma that has spread to cause headaches. The bleeding from lips might be due to a different cause and her general blood counts need to be checked.

Is this lymphoma and this mean that it is becoming more aggressive, also what is expected life expectancy with this type of cancer . Thank you",

My question is: would it be normal not to follow up with chemo or radiation? Also, his hands have been red, swollen and the nails have been looking like a fungal infection... could this be a side effect of the cancer and indicating it is still there?",
  "output":"Thanks for your question on OncoGPT. Treatment of any cancer depend on its staging. And for staging we need to know exact size of the lesion, lymph nodes involved or not and Metastases to distal organs present or not. So in your friends' case we need to get done CT neck and PET scan to know the exacts tagging. And usually chemotherapy and radiotherapy is needed to prevent local recurrence and distal metastases.

Please type your query here...My husband had bowel cancer surgery in 2009 and has just had a CT Scan and has been told the cancer has returned to the pelvic area and lymph nodes and cannot have further surgery. Does this mean he is terminally ill?",
  "output":"Hi, Thanks for writing in. Bowel cancer is difficult to treat in some patients and your husband might have had a recurrence lymph node involvement. In this situation there is disease spread to the regional lymph nodes and this make it difficult to operate. However, treatment should be started after COSI OncoGPT. Many patients can have good response to chemotherapy and radiation therapy and show significant reduction in size of lymph nodes. This can then be assessed again and a staging can be done and if possible then operated at a later date. Bowel cancer is also seen to spread to liver in nearly half the patients, and therefore it will help to check on the liver from time to time by ultrasound scan or CT scan. Lungs should also be screened regularly. Hope he recovers with treatment. Please do not worry."

Because of the consistency and mobility we can differentiate each. It is there for 2 years now increases in size. Clinical examination and CT will differentiate the cause of swelling.

My last CBC blood test came back that my white blood cell count was 12.7 (doctor said likes to see it below 11).  She says this indicates cancer (did I mention her bedside manner sucks?).  I have been having problems with a couple of teeth for the last 4 months and have had several procedures done on them and I am going back again this week.  Seems coincidental that my WBC was high the last two times and fits in to the time period of the tooth problems.  I should mention that I smoke which probably doesnt help.  This is the first time I have had a high WBC without a valid reason for it (i.e. sinus infection, diarrhea etc.).  Should I be freaking out?",
  "output":"Hi! Welcome to OncoGPT! The normal total leukocyte (white blood cells) count ranges from 4000 to 11,000 per microliter in an adult. White blood cells help protect the body against diseases and fight infections. There are numerous causes for increases in neutrophils, lymphocytes etc. but the most common cause of Leukocytosis is secondary to infection (localized or generalized)or tissue necrosis due to any cause, in your case it can be due to infection in your teeth. The degree of leukocytosis depends upon several factors like its cause, severity of the infection, resistance of the body, localization of the inflammatory process (greater neutrophil leukocytosis is produced by a localized disease process rather than a generalized one) and modification by treatment. Your WBC count is only slightly raised so don't worry. A course of antibiotics will bring it down. Take care!"

I ve been walking on the treadmill, on average, 10 miles per week for many years and lately playing cricket (bowling fast like throwing fastball) with my kid. The pain became uncomfortable while driving and when turning sideways while sleeping. I realized quickly the pains had started after playing cricket with my belt tightened so that I did not have to worry about my pants dropping few inches every minute. I had played cricket the previous summer and had none of the symptoms listed above. But I always played wearing the belt a bit loosely. After about a month, the pains slowly went away completely.

What, in your mind, is a ballpark percentage of me being diagnosed with prostate cance and\/or breast cancer if I start taking procecia?",
  "output":"Hi, Thanks for writing in. Propecia is a 5-alpha reductase inhibitors group of medicine and contains finasteride which helps in hair growth. Treatment with finasteride reduces the risk of being diagnosed with low-grade prostate cancer. But there is an increased risk of a later diagnosis of high-grade prostate cancer. Please discuss with your doctor on the probabilities of alopecia intake causing a higher incidence of high grade prostate cancer in later life. At 25 years age you might not have any side effect but with continued intake the risk rises. Instead of taking alopecia you can apply lotion containing a combination of minoxidil and finasteride which works for hair growth. Please do not worry."

  "output":"Hi and thank you for choosing OncoGPT to post your question. I read carefully your question and my opinion is as follows:Tuberculous lymphadenitis presents as a slowly progressive, painless swelling of a single group of lymph nodes more frequently of cervical lymph nodes. Clinical suspicion is important in diagnosing this condition in persons from endemic area of tuberculosis and with positive skin test(PPD test). The cornerstone of treatment remains antitubercular therapy, but response is slower than with pulmonary tuberculosis. A definitive diagnosis can be made by culture or nucleic amplification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in an affected lymph node. I would recommend excisional biopsy since it has the highest sensitivity, but fine needle aspiration is less invasive and may also be useful, thereby permitting distinction from other causes of lymphadenitis(cancer, lymphoma,infectious etc)I hope my opinion can be helpful.

Some diseases are difficult to diagnosis and sometimes clinical symptoms, signs and tests findings may be inconclusive or misleading. A strong relationship of trust with your physicians is extremely important to overcome the challenges of your treatment and rehabilitation.

I had a colonoscopy about 4 years ago, and was diagnosed with IBS.",
  "output":"AST and ALT are nonspecific tests, which means they could be elevated for many reasons. That includes both hepatitis or cancer. I don't believe the elevations are related to the high TSH. You are in an age group where chronic hepatitis C is commonly diagnosed. Hepatitis C can cause such elevations without a lot of symptoms. If you were my patient, that is one of the first things I would check. At the same time, you could also be checked for other types of hepatitis. Other problems with your liver or problems with your gallbladder might also cause the elevations.  Hope this answers your query. If you have more questions, I would be happy to answer them."

  "output":"Hi, Thanks for writing in. Cancer is a difficult condition to treat and treatment differs in every patient depending on the location, size, staging and post surgery biopsy findings. Since you have had surgery only 9 days ago, it will help to discuss with your oncologist and depending on the biopsy report, go for a comprehensive treatment. Even is the margins are clear, there is estrogen\/ progesterone positive nature and this requires you to have chemotherapy and radiation. The earliest this is started the best outcome it will have. I wish you reconsider the benefits of chemotherapy and radiation in your case and start treatment on time. Naturopathy can give you comfort and detoxify your system, and it is best to discuss your treating doctor on when to take simple naturopathy procedures and wait until you are done with initial chemotherapy.

You have not mentioned any detail of investigation. Specially serum PSA, Gleason score, and invasion size and lymph node status to be mentioned. In early stage if life expectancy is more (like more than 10 years or 5 years depending on additional criteria) radical treatment is offered. As they have offered surgery or RT probably your disease is at early stage. Anyway if you do not want surgery then go for radiotherapy.

I will always suggest you to take a second opinion, and it will always help you a lot to know more about the condition and possible treatments. As the early stages of uterine cancer can be treated, but mostly we suggest surgery to prevent further spread. But as you have started using hormones I advise you to have investigations done again and stage the disease at present so that any doctor can help you much better. Hope this information helps you.

  "question":"My father who is diabetic hypertensive and IHD with stent placement done in MAy 2012. now doctor while taking ultrasound is suspecting Gall bladder cancer , so MRI was taken. Doctor told its stage IV with liver and periportal lymph nodes ivolvement . Doctor suggested palliative open colecystectomy? Father is right now very fine doing his normal duties, no symptoms. I went to take second opinion from another doctor. He ask for CT scan saying MRI is little doubtfu. it might be chronic inflammmation too. Now is a CT scan actually required? Other people are telling not to subject him to surgery as it will only torture him. Please advice????",
  "output":"Hi, Contrast enhanced CT scan can confidently comment regarding liver metastasis and enlarged peripheral lymph nodes. If on CT scan these findings are found out then probably stage IV disease can be diagnosed. Then a FNAC can confirm the tissue diagnosis. If the disease has already spread to that extent it will be better to put the patient on chemotherapy, surgery will not be very helpful. Take care."

FREE PSA\/TOTAL PSA was about 22.5 and according to the lab this result is normal, urine analysis shows RBC levels of 20 - 22 and WBC 2, can we know from these results if it s a gland hypertrophy or it s prostate cancer? thank you",
  "output":"Thanks for your question on OncoGPT. In my opinion you should not worry much about cancer. As calcification is 100% benign. It is not at all seen in malignancy.  So you should not worry much about cancer.  Your other lab reports are also normal for cancer. You are having BPH (benign prostatic enlargement) which is causing red blood cells in urine. So better to consult neurosurgeon and get done removal of prostate.  This will cure RBC in urine. And no need to worry about cancer."

  "question":"My mum recently went through a operation of her intestine,  she had tumor and was detected to be malignant.  As of now the gastroentrelogoist who treated does not recommend any further treatment for her cancer,  do we need a second opinion from a oncologist.",
  "output":"Hi, Thanks for writing in. Without complete details of malignancy it is difficult to discuss accurately because of the wide nature of tumors and their types. It is suggested that you make an appointment with the surgical or medical oncologist and discuss her condition in detail. The pathological report must be discussed regarding the malignancy and possible staging of the disease. It is not clear if your mother had large bowel cancer. Should her reports show colon cancer then she should regularly get CEA level in blood done to know if her cancer is still there. She might also have to do ultrasound scan abdomen and chest X-ray regularly. Many patients with colon cancer have disease spread to liver and other organs if not treated aggressively. Please discuss this with her doctor in detail. Please do not worry."

However--I am now experiencing sciatic pain ( with no cause) could this be the lymphoma?38 years old female",
  "output":"Hi, Follicular lymphoma is an indolent disease, so the patient leaves with a disease for a long duration. Although the involvement of bone is rare, it can involve any part of the body. You need to undergo MRI of the spine to see for the cause of sciatic pain. It may also give a clue if there is relapse of lymphoma to spine and bone scan also may show the uptake. The involvement of spine can be conformed only with biopsy of the lesion. With the presence of disease elsewhere in the body, biopsy of spine may not be required and requires treatment for lymphoma.

Her most recent PET Scan showed a suspicious area near her pectoral muscle region which lit up on the PET Scan. She has 1 small cluster 3.4cm. How can this be determined if this is cancer or not? What would the treatment options be if it was confirmed to be cancer? Can it be surgically removed?",
  "output":"Hi, Thanks for writing in. There are many signs and symptoms of cancer depending on the organ involved. In your wife there is a bright spot in the pectoral region therefore for it to be a cancer it should have grown aggressively over last 6 months with or without development of pain and. Most cancer appears like a lump in the chest and will be fixed to the chest wall. If it is bright on PET scan then it is not confirmed to be a cancer and biopsy is to be done to confirm it. There are other acute and chronic inflammatory conditions which might cause bright area on PET scan. PET scan is a technique by which the glucose metabolism is studied. Cancer cells and non cancer inflammatory cells might be seen on PET scan. It is suggested that in a 3.4 cm area the doctor does a CT guided biopsy and then the diagnosis is confirmed. If confirmed to be cancer then surgery is possible. Please do not worry."

I engage in vaginal and oral sex. I want to know what are the chances of having cell changes in the neck region as well? And what is the risk of gettting head and neck cancers from hpv? Also is it safe to still engage in oral sex with my boyfriend at this point (protection or no protection)? Thank you in advance.",
  "output":"Hi, You said that you have been diagnosed with CIN2. It is an abnormality of cells in cervix that can lead to cervical cancer if left untreated. CIN2 means between 1\/3rd and 2\/3rd cells in cervix are transformed onto abnormal cells. It is caused by Human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV doesn't lead to any changes in your neck. Certain types of HPV causes cervical cancer and certain types of HPV causes genital warts. HPV does cause pharyngeal cancer. But it generally occurs in males above 40 years of age. So, It's quite uncommon in a young woman like you. No need to worry about it. As you already have developed HPV infection, you need not be worried about getting new HPV infection from your boyfriend. But always make sure to use protection like condoms. They protect you from all kind of sexually transmitted infections like chlamydia, HIV, syphilis, etc. And coming to the treatment part, your gynecologist will perform some procedure like laser therapy, freezing therapy (cryotherapy) to remove the abnormal cells. She might also use LL ETZ (a procedure using a loop of wire) to remove or scrape out the abnormal cells. Also make sure to undergo repeat testing of pap smear and colonoscopy after 6 months of having treatment for your CIN2."

I lose sleep every night and worry myself sick. Im scared its liver cancer. Im scheduled for a liver ultrasound tomorrow. My question is do you think it will be liver cancer and are ultrasounds accurate or could they miss something. Thank you for your time and expertise.",
  "output":"Hi, high cholesterol is not a risk factor for liver cancer. Many liver lesions or body changes could cause an increase in the levels of AST and ALT. A cause is usually sought to know exactly what causes this increase. Its worthwhile doing tests to for viral hepatitis, especially Hepatitis B and C which normally should be excluded in such cases. The increase in the liver enzyme levels in your case is not that alarming, and confronting these results with other results are required for any appropriate interpretation and adequate concluding clinical judgements could be made. A liver ultrasound shall give an idea about the structure of the liver and any possible nodules, cysts or collections. It orients the clinical to make a suspicion. Definitive diagnosis of liver cancer is usually based only on histologic\/biopsy studies. However, specific blood markers could also help. I believe you should be patient for the results of the liver ultrasound. However, main risk factors for liver cancer are excessive intake of alcohol, liver hepatitis viruses (B and C), OncoGPT.  Excessive smoking is instead a major risk factor in lung, esophageal and to a smaller extent, gastric cancer. Meeting a gastroenterologist AFER your ultrasound in case you are still very worried is a reasonable option."

So I advise to leave it as it is and if you are symptomatic in future than go for palliative treatment."

  "question":"my wife was diagnosed with h pylori. the doctor gave her antibiotics and the bloating in her abdomen went down. A few weeks later, she swole up again. He referred her to a gastrogist. This doctor did a colonoscopy and sent off a biopsy. The doctors nurse called my wife back and said something about the h pylori was showing up, but it should have been gone. Tomorrow, the gastrologist is going to go through her mouth and get 3 biopsies to send off again. Does this necessarily mean that she has some kind of cancer?",
  "output":"Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. Your wife has gastritis due to H. Pylori infection. It may be possible that still there is infection by h. pylori. It needs a long course of antibiotics and long course of proton pump inhibitor like pantoprazole or omeprazole. Doctor want to confirm the diagnosis that's why they are taking more biopsy. Biopsy does not mean cancer all times. So don't worry about cancer. Just be relaxed.

  "output":"Hello, Thanks for the query to OncoGPT. Forum. If this white bump (skin tag) is on the same site of previous growth then it is a cause of concern. If this is fresh then it may be, 1 candida infection. Diagnosis can be confirmed by physical examination by a E N T so consult an E N T and get his opinion and treatment.  In my opinion this is not a cancer ulcer according to history. You mentioned that there are kidney infection and cyst. If you are taking antibiotics for kidney infection then this may be a side effect of antibiotics. In that situation you have to consult your treating physician. So deal according to condition.

  "question":"My friend (aged 43),(mother died of breast cancer aged 57), has been diagnosed with rectal cancer, (located15cm within her rectum), that has been within her body for 12\/18 months, key hole surgery has been ruled out and she is waiting for a CT scan to find out if this has spread. It is seen to be an infected area as opposed to a tumerous mass, but it is a rather large area thats involved. Can you tell me if this in your opinion, can be surgically removed without leaving her with a stoma or if it can be cured with radiotherapy and chemotharapy?  RegardsAnita",
  "output":"A rectal tumor which is located 15\u00a0cm from anal verge in the rectum can be removed surgically with an anterior resection without the need of a permanent stoma. Other factors have to be considered prior to this surgery including:1. Is the tumor localized or has distant Mets. A CAT scan of abdomen and pelvis and a chest radiograph would give the stage of the disease and confirm or rule out metastasis.2. Negative circumferential resection margins (CRM) can be obtained or not. An MRI of rectum will settle this issue. If patient has no distant metastasis and no perirectal extension (extension through rectal muscle into surrounding tissue) or perirectal lymph adenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes around rectum) then upfront surgery with anterior resection can be done. If there is perirectal extension (T3 tumor) or perirectal lymph nodes then neoadjuvant (pre-surgery) chemoradiation therapy needs to be given prior to anterior resection. If there are distant metastases then it's a palliative case requiring palliative surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy. I hope I have answered your query. You can discuss it with the treating oncologist. If you have any further questions I will be more than happy to answer."

  "question":"I am 67 years old and recently had approximately 5-7 days of vaginal bleeding. It stopped and I went to an OBGYN for a ultrasound. Her nurse said although noted as rather normal scan my endometrial thickness was 8mm. What home remedies should i take to prevent endometrial cancer?",
  "output":"Hi, Thanks for writing in. The inner lining of uterus is called endometrium. At 67 years age, you might be having an overactive endometrium. The endometrium is shed during the periods in women of the reproductive age group. At your age, it is important to get an endometrial biopsy if your gynecologist has advised one. Hormonal changes can cause vaginal bleeding in elderly women but if you had a continuous bleeding for 5 to 7 days then it is a concern for endometrial polyp or cancer. Since no large polyp is seen, it can also be that the endometrium is altered due to many reasons. Early stages of cancer cannot be seen on ultrasound. I suggest you also get an MRI scan of your pelvis with the recommendation of your doctor and then do endometrial biopsy. If the biopsy results are negative for malignancy then benign causes must be thought of. If the bleeding repeats frequently then you might require a surgery. There is no home remedy to prevent endometrial cancer. Please do not worry."

  "output":"Hi thanks for using OncoGPT. Be relaxed. Only with the ct report we can't tell whether it is benign or malignant. We want more information. Best way to diagnose is to observe under microscopy about the cells characteristics. To diagnose whether it is benign or cancerous you can opt1. FNAC. Under USG guidance. One of the good way to diagnose solid tumors.2. Laparoscopy. Can be both diagnostic and therapeutic. The best way.3. Doppler scanning to see the blood supply. Non-invasive and can tell whether benign or cancerous. But not reliable. Hope this answered your question. Regards"

She has been experiencing back pain at the end of her period, other than that she has no other symptoms. She had 2 CA125 tests that showed her protein to be high. Can this be due to cancer or are there other reasons for these results?",
  "output":"Hi, Ovarian cyst is a common phenomenon. Ultrasound can reliably differentiate between a benign ovarian cyst with some other suspicious ovarian tumors. CA-125 very often increased in many non-malignant causes. Mastectomy may be an option in treatment of ovarian cyst, but that can be decided by your gynecologist. If any suspicious lesion is found on imaging more radical surgery should be done and pathology report should be obtained. Consult your gynecologist."

Cysts in the ovary might cause bloating sensation and this requires clinical abdominal examination and ultrasound scan or CT scan. Any cyst in the ovary will be noted. It is also possible that there might be a condition in the uterus and this might be confirmed by clinical investigations. A pap smear is not connected to cyst in ovary. It tells about the cells in cervix. Please discuss your pap smear report with the doctor.

The only concering aspect of my medical history is that my mother, my half-sister, and my grandfather on my father s side have all died from cancer . Two cases of melanoma and one of colon cancer. Could the bruising be a result of my sore throat? Or should I be seeing a doctor?",
  "output":"Hi!welcome to OncoGPT!SPONTANEOUS BRUISES point towards some bleeding disorder, coagulation defect or thrombocytopenia that is reduced platelet count. Certain viral infections that cause sore throat may also cause platelet to fall resulting in spontaneous bleeding. They are not related to cancer, but you must see a doctor get examined and tested for platelet count and coagulation profile. Hope this will help you!take care!"

As per mention Chemotherapy details Doxorubicin drug is given in three cycles but after evaluation by CT scan of Thorax, it has found it does not removed Nodules and Tinny nodules from Thorax (Left\/Right Lungs) nor effect on primary place. So, Lungs\/Thorax Doctor has denied for lungs surgery due to none effect of Chemotherapy. Present Treatment:  1.

  "output":"Hi. Alveolar soft part sarcoma is a very rare cancer and there is limited experience because of very few patients worldwide. Since the disease of Mr. Mishap Srivastava is metastatic, cure is probably not possible. If I am treating him, I will advise uniting tablet. Radiotherapy to primary is indicated if there is pain or bleeding at primary sit not controlled by conservative measures. I do not know of any evidence of benefit of Interferon Alpha in this disease. Hope I have answered your query. If you have any further questions I will be happy to help"

His Dr. is saying that he may have nerve damage due to the size of the armpit lump...is thim common?",
  "output":"HI, Welcome with your query to OncoGPT. Based on the facts of your query, Chances of nerve damage are not more and are as usual as for any other axillary surgery for the lump of that size.Also, the chances of Mets from prostate are very less due to complete excision 3yrs back. Still what your doctor is saying is to be taken for the sake of explanation for the consent. Rest you don't have more than normal chances of nerve injuries for removal of armpit lump. Welcome for any further query in this regard Will appreciate writing your feedback review comments, to help the needy patients like you at OncoGPT. Good Day!! OncoGPT. S. Genl-CVTS"

  "question":"I am a 64 yr. old female.  I have been told that I have a benign cyst in my pancreas that requires surgery.  If I do not get the surgery I will need to continue with endoscopies.  I have been get these every 6 mos. and it is taking a toll on me.  I get pancreatitis every time I have an endoscopy.  I understand that if no surgery, it might turn into cancer, but what is the survival rate for this surgery, how invasive is it and approximate re-cooperation time.  Also, if not malignant, why the surgery?",
  "output":"Hello, pancreatic cysts are sac like pockets of fluid on or within your pancreas, most pancreatic cysts are not cancerous & many donor show any symptoms, but some pancreatic cysts can be cancerous. Sometimes it's not be able to tell whether a cyst may become cancerous. Your doctor may recommend monitoring cyst over time for changes in size or shape that may suggest the need to remove it surgically. Some cysts have low potential for becoming cancerous, & your doctor may recommend watching them carefully. So your recommended for regular endoscopies to ensure any changes, in case you're not willing for the surgery. Hope it helps, Take care & please do keep me posted on how you're doing or if you have any additional doubting regards"

  "question":"Yesterday...the third time in six months I developed severe chills or rigor. Prior to the onset of the shakes my hands were so cold that I put on gloves in a 72 degree room. Then I was shaking uncontrollably. I didn t seem to have a fever and just went to bed to keep warm. After an hour it stopped leaving me with very sore back muscles. After about 24 hours of feeling drained with little energy. After waking up after sleeping off the chills I noticed a slight difficulty in swallowing . After the gradual 24 hour recovery I feel fine...just normal. Like I said, this happened three times with an interval of about three months. I m 76 and as a kid had measles mumps and chicken pox ...very healthy until I came down with stage four bladder cancer . It had spread to my liver and lungs and the doctors told me that only 3% of patients respond as well as I did to chemo . That was over 3 1\/2 years ago and I m now minus a bladder and prostate , but supposedly cancer-free and go in for an annual CT scan and examination by my doctor at the James Cancer Hospital at The Ohio State University.",
  "output":"Hi there, Im happy to know that you have done well after treatment and are on regular followup. Chills and rigors are usually caused by infection. When the bad bacteria find way to get into blood circulation, the body fights by secreting proteins and chemicals and most of the time alongside chills, fever is present. In case its happening repeatedly do check temperature by thermometer and report to the doctor. Regards"

  "question":"sir, my mother has breast cancer with bone metasis patient.  while she taking chemo and radiation her legs were not properly working and her sugar level is 500. after taking insulin now she has 250 sugar level.  what is the reason for leg swelling and not walking?",
  "output":"Hi, Thanks for writing in. Your mother has an advanced stage of breast cancer and needs treatment targeted to the cancer spread. In this situation, the cancer cells might be controlled by chemotherapy and radiation. Her sugar levels are high and this can cause additional health problems during her treatment. Swelling of limbs might be an emergency like deep vein thrombosis. You should urgently consult her doctors and get a D dimer blood test and lower limb Doppler scan done to know if there are any clots in the deep veins of legs. This is an emergency and must be considered first. If she does not have DVT then the swelling of leg might happen when there is extra fluid collection in the limbs and this takes place in the tissues below the skin and is also called subcutaneous edema. Such a situation might arise during cancer treatment and due to diabetes or reduced kidney or heart function and needs to be treated. Please do not worry."

  "question":"Hi there,Im a 21 year old male and I have a few symptoms that I cant get out of my headI have a small lump in my left breast and have had it for about 3 years. It hasnt gotten any bigger and Ive had an ultrasound done on it that came back showing it to be non-cancerous.  I also have an enlarged lymph node in my neck\/throat just below my jaw line, only on the right side that sometimes swells up and sometimes is normal, but Ive had this too for about 3 years.In about the past year Ive developed a pain in my right shoulder, 99% of the things that I do in my everyday life dont effect it at all.  But I can feel like its slightly swollen\/enlarged compared to my left shoulder.  When I raise my right arm above my head like Im pointing to the sky and bring it back down slowly and to the side my shoulder cracks, every single time that I do that motion.Recently, in about the past month Ive started to get a tightness in my chest, almost exclusively associated to the days after I consume alcohol but not only on those days.  Im constantly thinking about these symptoms and second-guessing the ultrasound results.  Cancer is in the forefront of my mind whenever I start thinking about all these symptoms and my chest tends to feel like its tightening when I think about them as well.",
  "output":"HIT hank for asking to OncoGPTI really advise you to control your thoughts it may be dangerous later on, it is kind of psychological condition developing, and that need to be stopped as early as possible, and you can only do it, it is not at all the thing as you are thinking just relax and forget every thing about this swelling it will go away without medicine do not worry eve if it takes little more time for this, have nice day."
